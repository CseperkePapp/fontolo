# Fontolo - Live CSS Configurator and Design System

🎨 **Currently refining** - Functional live configurator with full CSS framework export

## CURRENT BRANCH - Splitting Components.css CSS Structure into:

Components.css and
- `demo.css` – visual showcases
- `overrides.css` – context-specific tweaks or bugfixes

## Working Branches

- `main` – stable demo version
- `component-split` – refactored CSS experiments

*A customizable, token-driven design system and live CSS configuration tool for modern web development*

## 🎯 What is Fontolo?

Fontolo is a **living design system generator** that lets you visually configure design tokens and see them work in real-time. It's a complete UI framework that demonstrates itself through its own interface.

**Try it now:** [Live Configurator](fontolodemo.html)

**What makes Fontolo unique:**
- **Self-demonstrating system** - every UI component proves the design system works
- **Complete framework export** - get tokens, utilities, and battle-tested components
- **Live preview** - see changes instantly across typography, colors, spacing, and animations
- **Professional components** - tabs, accordions, forms, notifications, and more

## 🧠 A New Approach to Design Thinking

Fontolo represents a **novel paradigm** in web design tooling - instead of static mockups and disconnected style guides, you work with **living, interactive design systems**. Every change is instant, every component proves itself in real-time, and the entire interface demonstrates its own capabilities.

This approach opens up possibilities we're actively exploring:
- **Live documentation** that visitors can customize and interact with
- **Visual development environments** where design and code merge seamlessly  
- **Client presentation tools** with real-time design exploration
- **Interactive component libraries** that go beyond traditional style guides
- **Collaborative design systems** where teams can iterate together in real-time

*This is just the beginning - we have several exciting directions planned for expanding this foundation.*

## ✨ Current Features (Ready to Use)

### Live Configuration
- Real-time preview with instant updates.
- HSL color system with automatic variants.
- Modular typography scales (Golden ratio, custom ratios).
- Smart accessibility features with automatic contrast checking.
- Dynamic Google Fonts integration.

### Complete CSS Framework Export
- Design tokens as CSS custom properties.
- Utility class system for rapid development.
- Professional UI components (buttons, cards, forms, tabs, accordions).
- Three-layer spacing system with predictable layouts.
- Animation framework with easing functions.

### Battle-Tested Components
All components are built and proven within Fontolo itself:
- Navigation and tab controls
- Form elements with custom styling
- Accordion panels with smooth animations
- Notification system
- Card layouts and grid systems

## 🏗️ Current Status

Fontolo is in active refinement with a **functional core system** that already demonstrates something new in web design tooling. The live configurator works, exports complete CSS frameworks, and proves the concept of self-demonstrating design systems.

**What's working now:**
- Live configuration system in the main configurator (fontolodemo.html)
- Complete CSS framework export with production-ready code
- Professional UI component library demonstrated across multiple layout styles
- Novel three-layer CSS architecture that eliminates common spacing problems

**What we're refining:**
- Extending live configuration to all demo pages and layouts
- User experience and interface polish across different contexts
- Component library expansion and customization options

**Where we're heading:**
This foundation opens doors to entirely new approaches in visual web development. We're exploring how live design systems could transform everything from client presentations to collaborative development workflows. The self-demonstrating concept is just the beginning of what's possible when design tokens become interactive parameters rather than static files.

**Development philosophy:** Built for the joy of creation and shared openly because innovative tools should be accessible to everyone. This project grows through community engagement and real-world use cases.
