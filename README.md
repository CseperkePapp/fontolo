# Fontolo - Live CSS Configurator and Design System

üé® **Currently refining** - Functional live configurator with full CSS framework export

## CURRENT BRANCH - Splitting Components.css CSS Structure into:

Components.css and
- `demo.css` ‚Äì visual showcases
- `overrides.css` ‚Äì context-specific tweaks or bugfixes

## Working Branches

- `main` ‚Äì stable demo version
- `component-split` ‚Äì refactored CSS experiments

*A customizable, token-driven design system and live CSS configuration tool for modern web development*

## üéØ What is Fontolo?

Fontolo is a **living design system generator** that lets you visually configure design tokens and see them work in real-time. It's a complete UI framework that demonstrates itself through its own interface.

**Try it now:** [Live Configurator](fontolodemo.html)

**What makes Fontolo unique:**
- **Self-demonstrating system** - every UI component proves the design system works
- **Complete framework export** - get tokens, utilities, and battle-tested components
- **Live preview** - see changes instantly across typography, colors, spacing, and animations
- **Professional components** - tabs, accordions, forms, notifications, and more

## üß† A New Approach to Design Thinking

Fontolo represents a **novel paradigm** in web design tooling - instead of static mockups and disconnected style guides, you work with **living, interactive design systems**. Every change is instant, every component proves itself in real-time, and the entire interface demonstrates its own capabilities.

This approach opens up possibilities we're actively exploring:
- **Live documentation** that visitors can customize and interact with
- **Visual development environments** where design and code merge seamlessly  
- **Client presentation tools** with real-time design exploration
- **Interactive component libraries** that go beyond traditional style guides
- **Collaborative design systems** where teams can iterate together in real-time

*This is just the beginning - we have several exciting directions planned for expanding this foundation.*

## üèóÔ∏è Current Status

Fontolo is in active refinement with a **functional core system** that already demonstrates something new in web design tooling. The live configurator works, exports complete CSS frameworks, and proves the concept of self-demonstrating design systems.

**What's working now:**
- Live configuration system in the main configurator (fontolodemo.html)
- Complete CSS framework export with production-ready code
- Professional UI component library demonstrated across multiple layout styles
- Novel three-layer CSS architecture that eliminates common spacing problems

**What we're refining:**
- Extending live configuration to all demo pages and layouts
- User experience and interface polish across different contexts
- Component library expansion and customization options

**Where we're heading:**
This foundation opens doors to entirely new approaches in visual web development. We're exploring how live design systems could transform everything from client presentations to collaborative development workflows. The self-demonstrating concept is just the beginning of what's possible when design tokens become interactive parameters rather than static files.

**Development philosophy:** Built for the joy of creation and shared openly because innovative tools should be accessible to everyone. This project grows through community engagement and real-world use cases.
