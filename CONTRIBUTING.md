# Contributing to Fontolo

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Fontolo is exploring new paradigms in visual web development, and we welcome community input as we refine this foundation.

## How to Contribute

**Bug Reports**
- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
- Share what you expected vs what happened
- Test with different browsers if possible

**Feature Requests**
- Describe your use case and why the feature would be helpful
- Consider how it fits with the "live design system" philosophy
- Feel free to propose implementation ideas

**Code Contributions**
- Fork the repository
- Make your changes and test with the live configurator
- Ensure changes work across the component library
- Submit a pull request with clear description of what and why

**Design & UX Feedback**
- Share your experience using the configurator
- Suggest interface improvements or workflow enhancements
- Propose new component patterns or layout ideas

**Documentation & Examples**
- Help improve explanations and guides
- Share how you're using Fontolo in real projects
- Create example implementations or integration guides

**Integration Examples & Guides**
- The CSS export is complete but needs practical integration examples
- Help create real-world implementation guides for different frameworks
- Share working examples of Fontolo CSS in actual projects
- Document best practices for integrating the exported design system

## Current Focus Areas

We're currently refining:
- **Live configuration experience** - Making the real-time updates more intuitive and responsive
- **CSS architecture refinement** - Perfecting the three-layer spacing system and component patterns  
- **Export functionality** - Ensuring generated CSS is production-ready and well-organized
- **Integration guidance** - The CSS export works, but we need clear examples of how to use it in real projects
- **Component library expansion** - Adding new UI patterns while maintaining the self-demonstrating approach
- **Cross-browser compatibility** - Testing and optimizing across different environments
- **Performance optimization** - Smooth interactions even with complex configurations

## What We Need Help With

**High Priority:**
- Real-world integration examples (WordPress themes, React apps, static sites)
- Documentation on how to actually USE the exported CSS
- Testing the exported CSS in different project contexts
- Identifying gaps between what we export and what developers actually need

## Development Philosophy

Fontolo is built for the joy of creation and shared openly because innovative design tools should be accessible to everyone. We're exploring what becomes possible when design systems become interactive and self-demonstrating rather than static documentation.
